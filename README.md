****Create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub, Jenkins, SonarCube, and Docker on EC2 instances. ****

Hereâ€™s another exciting project of building a robust CI/CD pipeline using cutting-edge technologies like GitHub, Jenkins, SonarCube, and Docker. As a Cloud DevOps engineer, you will implement a seamless pipeline for coded development, testing, and deployment. 

****Project Overview: ****
The goal of this project is to create an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline that automates the process of code integration, testing for bugs and vulnerabilities using SonarCube, and deploying the code in Docker containers. The pipeline will be orchestrated through Jenkins, providing an efficient and streamlined workflow. 

****Project Steps: ****
**1. Setting Up Jenkins for Automated Pipeline:**
- Update the machine and install Java runtime environment.
- Allow port 8080 for Jenkins web access.
- Verify installation and access Jenkins webpage.
- Create a user, set up plugins, and create a pipeline for automated workflow.

**2. Automated Triggering of Jenkins Pipeline from GitHub:**
- Configure source code management in Jenkins with Git repository URL.
- Enable GitHub webhook trigger in Jenkins project settings.
- Verify webhook configuration by building the pipeline.
- Automate the process of pulling code from GitHub using webhooks. 

**3. Installation and Setup of SonarCube:**
- Download and install Java 17.
- Download and unzip SonarCube.
- Execute the sonar.sh script.
- Configure security group for SonarCube.
- Access SonarCube web interface.
- Setup a project in SonarCube using Jenkins. 

**4.Install and Configure SonarCube Scanner in Jenkins Pipeline:**
- Copy project key from SonarCube for later use.
- Create a token in SonarCube with a 30-day expiry.
- Install SonarCube plugin and SSH plugin in Jenkins.
- Configure SonarCube scanner in Global Tool Configuration.
- Configure SonarCube server in Jenkins system settings.
- Add build step in Jenkins pipeline for SonarCube scanning.
- Paste the project key and SonarCube token.
- Save configurations and verify the SonarCube scan status.

**5. Deploy Code on Docker:**
- Install Docker on the EC2 instance.
- Configure Docker and update packages. 

**6. Executing Remote Commands on Docker Server:**
- Configure Jenkins system with Docker server details.
- Run remote commands on Docker server.
- Create Dockerfile and copy contents to Docker server. 

**7. Deploying Code on Docker Container and Accessing it through a Browser:**
- Create a Docker repository and move it to a remote server using SCP command.
- Configure Jenkins pipeline, build the code, and verify success.
- Fix permission denied error for running Docker commands.
- Build Docker image and run a container.
- Allow port 8085 for accessing the running container.
- Verify website functionality and address any CSS loading issues. 

****Summary: ****
By completing this project, you will have developed a hands-on understanding of building a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub, Jenkins, SonarCube, and Docker. This pipeline not only enhances the efficiency of coded development but also ensures high-quality code by incorporating automated testing and security checks.
